# FUNDME SMART CONTRACT:
The FundMe smart contract is a decentralized application built on a blockchain platform that enables individuals to contribute funds to a specific cause or project. This smart contract provides a transparent and secure way for people to donate money while ensuring that only the owner of the contract can withdraw the funds.
